# contractwalletfactory
Here is an example of a wallet factory using solidity
In this example, the WalletFactory contract creates new instances of the Wallet contract. The createWallet function creates a new instance of the Wallet contract and adds its address to the wallets array. The getWallets function returns the array of all wallet addresses. The Wallet contract has a balance variable to store the funds and two functions to deposit and withdraw funds.
